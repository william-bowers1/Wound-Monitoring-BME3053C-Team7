# Wound-Monitoring-BME3053C-Team7

This program takes an image of a wound, thresholds the wound bed, and then thresholds the granulating tissue inside the wound bed. To use the program, load the image you want to analyze, then run the program. The outputs will show the masks created from the total wound bed thresholding and the granulating tissue thresholding, as well as a calculation of percent area based on these relative measures. Over time, changes in this percentage of granulating tissue can be used to assess wound healing progression.
